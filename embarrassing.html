<p> One of my embarrassing moments was when I'm in my elementary days. I'm just waiting at our lobby for our next class and there are many students that time. When suddenly, I felt dizzy and I fell. Some students saw me and laughed at me. I was very shy and ended up
going to the bathroom. </p>

<p> This happened at mcdonalds. Me and my friends decided to go to mcdo because one of my friends treated us food. One of my friends bought the rice meals while me bought the softdrinks. Because of my excitement, I slipped on the floor and the softdrinks spilled at me.
I was so embarrassed that time because many people are eating that time. My friends laughed at me very hard. </p>
