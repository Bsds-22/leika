<p> This is one of my unforgettable moments. I was in senior highschool. This is our prom. It is unforgettable for me because it is my first time to attend prom because I did not attend the prom in highschool. These times were so fun.  </p>

<p>This is also unforgettable because it's my first time joining Lakan at Lakambni at our school in senior high school. It was a very nerve racking moment because many people are watching us, but it is also a fun experience.  </p>
